# PyBer_Analysis
# Purpose of Review
This analysis was requested by the CEO of Pyber, V. Isualize, and my direct supervisor, Omar after the second week at PyBer which is a Python based ride sharing app company.

The important data we are focusing on will be total rides, drivers and fares. Along with that we will be looking at average fare per ride and average fare per driver. These categories will all be based in the three city types rural, suburban and urban.

This will be done by using the program Jupyter while recording through png files the data we want to show Omar and V. Isualize.

# End Results

- Total Rides: 2,375

- Total Drivers: 2,973

- Total Fares: $63,358

- Average Fare Per Ride
  - Rural at $34.62
  - Suburban at $30.97
  - Urban at $24.53

The average fare per ride is significantly higher in Rural vs. Urban at almost $10 more per ride.

- Average Fare per Driver
  - Rural at $55.49  
  - Surburban at $39.50  
  - Urban at $16.57

### Total Fare By City
 Urban has a the lead in fares with suburban in the middle and rural being the lowest. With this data being specifically from January 2019 to April 2019 we can state that urban rides cost significantly higher than the other two city types.

# Summary

The recommendations as requested by CEO V. Isualize are:

- Increase the amount of drivers in Rural and Suburban areas
  - This will directly increase the Average Fare Per Ride revenue
  - Add incentives that would increase total revenue for the company per ride
  - Increase the number of drivers which then would lead to our average revenue going up
  - Offer higher salaries to the drivers working in these regions as our average fare more than doubles from Urban to Surburban city types

- Increase average fare per ride in Urban areas:
  - Total Rides within this region double Surburban areas and are almost fifteen times more frequent than Rural areas
  - The average fare per ride can increase total revenue for the company

- Give driver initiatives to transfer from Urban to Rural or Suburban areas. 
  - Rural areas have 125 Rides requested with 78 drivers to fill the demand. 
  - Suburban areas have 625 rides requested with 490 drivers to fill the demand.
    - By transferring drivers from Urban to Rural or Suburban areas it will help meet the ride to driver demand while hopefully giving more frequent work to the overall driver pool since Urban areas have more drivers than rides being requested.
